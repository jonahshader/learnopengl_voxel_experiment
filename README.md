Voxel Engine with indefinite generation in all three axes

![Alt Text](https://github.com/jonahshader/learnopengl_voxel_experiment/blob/master/images/screenshot.png)

This is a voxel engine written in C++ using OpenGL for rendering. I wanted to create an engine that generated "infinite" worlds in all three axes, as opposed to minecraft where only two axes are indefinite and one (y axis) is limited. Existing engines like unreal engine and unity are strongly coupled with static worlds, which makes developing fully procedural games difficult. That is why I ended up developing my own engine from scratch.
